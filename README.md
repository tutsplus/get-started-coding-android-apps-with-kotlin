Do you want to get started coding Android apps? Chose Kotlin as your language to begin. Traditionally, Android apps are developed in Java, but Java is old and Kotlin has fixed a lot of its problems, making your code cleaner, more concise and faster. 

In this course, you will learn how to code a simple app with Kotlin. You'll start by installing Android Studio with the Kotlin plugins in order to create and run your first Android app. You'll then go on to learn some of the basics of views and layouts in Android, how to use Android Intents, and how to use some of Kotlin's special features to write safer, more concise code. By the end of this course, you'll be able to use Android and Kotlin to build basic app with cleaner code.
